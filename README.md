Objective- Development of machine-learning based approaches for the identification of expansin proteins

Why Expansins?
Expansins play an important role in cell wall remodeling and disassembly necessary for plant growth and acclimatization[1], apart from this also plays a crucial role in activities such as differentiation, transport, communication, senescence, abscission, plant-pathogen interactions and ultimately plant growth[2]

Enable cell expansion by triggering a pH dependent relaxation of the cell wall which loosens and softens the cell wall.

Areas of application  :-
-Increased fruit firmness ( To increase the shelf life of fruits and vegetables)
-Increased rate of light-induced stomatal opening and reduced sensitivity of stomata to the stimuli [3]
-Enhanced growth and larger leaves under normal growth conditions[4]
-Accelerated root growth[6]

Steps followed to build a Machine learning (ML) model :-
1) Data Collected
2) Redundancy removed
3) Dataset in 2 ratios (1:1 and 1:2)
3) Feature calculation
4) Different ML models were built (ex- SVM, Decision Tree Classifier e.t.c)
5) Finally two features in two different ratios and their corresponding model were choosen (SVM with rbf kernel)
6) Flask was used to create the webserver
